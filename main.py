Main runs, spawns two threads
    One thread waiting for time that alarm goes off checking alarm_times variable, runs forever
    One thread sending beats every 30 seconds, receives back alarm times and updates alarm_times variable, runs forever
When time, set flag for alarm, beat to alert website, call phone to start, start new threads
    One thread play sound, checking flag for code turned off, dies when turned off
    One thread waits a CALL_TIME amount of time, then if the alarm is still ringing, redials the phone,
        dies when alarm stops ringing
    One thread check website for flag turned off, then changes internal flag and dies
